HTML means HyperText Markup Language. It is the basic language used to make web pages. When you open a website in a browser, the browser reads the HTML and shows the content on your screen. HTML does not add colors, styles, or effects. It only tells what should appear, like text, headings, images, or links. HTML uses simple words called “tags” to show where each part starts and ends. For example, a tag can tell the browser, “this is a heading,” or “this is a paragraph.” Without HTML, web pages would not have any structure or content. It is the first thing you must learn if you want to create a website.

    CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to make web pages look beautiful. While HTML gives the structure of the page, CSS controls the design. With CSS, we can change colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and positions of things on a web page. For example, we can make the background red, the text larger, or move items to the center. CSS does not create content — it only changes how the content looks. It is very important for making websites clean, modern, and easy to read. Without CSS, all websites would look plain and simple.

ChatGPT said:
JavaScript is a programming language that makes web pages active and interactive. While HTML gives structure and CSS gives style, JavaScript adds actions to a website. It helps a website respond when a user clicks a button, types in a form, or moves the mouse. For example, JavaScript can show or hide content, create sliders, check form answers, or update part of the page without reloading it. JavaScript runs inside the browser and helps make websites fast, smart, and easy to use. It is one of the most important parts of modern web development.
